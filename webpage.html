                        I am a BSc. graduated in Mechatronics Engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) working as Research Engineer for the Brain Body Interaction Lab at Harvard University. 
                        My primary research interests are in Control Theory, Dynamical Systems and Computational Neuroscience. I aspire to find a mathematical or computational representation that would describe the brain-body and multi-organ feedback systems.
